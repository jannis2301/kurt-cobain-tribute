      <h2 id="headline">Timeline of Kurt Cobain's life:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1967</strong> - Born in Aberdeen, Washington</li>
        <li><strong>1985</strong> - Forms his first music band "Fecal Matter". After one year the band disbands.</li>
        <li><strong>1987</strong> - Founds "Nirvana" together with Krist Novoselic. The band name was
          taken from the Buddhist concept, which Cobain described as "freedom from pain, suffering and
          the external world", a concept that he aligned with the punk rock ethos and ideology.</li>
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - The Album "Nevermind" was released. With Nevermind's lead single, "Smells Like Teen
          Spirit", Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of alternative rock called "grunge".
        </li>
        <li><strong>1992</strong> - A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that
          Nirvana had layed at a gay rights benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon.</li>
        <li><strong>1993</strong> - Releases the live album MTV Unplugged in New York. It features an acoustic
          performance recorded at Sony Music Studios for the television series MTV Unplugged. Cobain suggested that the
          stage be decorated with stargazer lilies, black candles, and a crystal chandelier. Coletti asked him, "You
          mean like a funeral?", to which Cobain replied, "Exactly. Like a funeral."</li>
        <li><strong>1994</strong> - Cobain dies at the age of 27 at his home in Seattle. He was found with a heroin
          overdose and shot in the head from his Browning Auto 5 self-loading shotgun. He left a suicide note that ended
          with a quote from the Neil Young song My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue):
