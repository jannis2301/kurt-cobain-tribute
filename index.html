              <strong>1987</strong> - Founds "Nirvana" together with Krist
              Novoselic. The band name was taken from the Buddhist concept,
              which Cobain described as "freedom from pain, suffering and the
              external world", a concept that he aligned with the punk rock
              ethos and ideology.

            <li class="timeline-points">
              <strong>1991</strong> - The Album "Nevermind" was released. With
              Nevermind's lead single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Nirvana
              quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of
              alternative rock called "grunge".
            </li>
            <li class="timeline-points">
              <strong>1992</strong> - A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and
              homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had layed at a gay
              rights benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon.

            <li class="timeline-points">
              <strong>1993</strong> - Releases the live album MTV Unplugged in
              New York. It features an acoustic performance recorded at Sony
              Music Studios for the television series MTV Unplugged. Cobain
              suggested that the stage be decorated with stargazer lilies, black
              candles, and a crystal chandelier. Coletti asked him, "You mean
              like a funeral?", to which Cobain replied, "Exactly. Like a
              funeral."
            </li>
            <li class="timeline-points">
              <strong>1994</strong> - Cobain dies at the age of 27 at his home
              in Seattle. He was found with a heroin overdose and shot in the
              head from his Browning Auto 5 self-loading shotgun. He left a
              suicide note that ended with a quote from the Neil Young song My
              My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue):
